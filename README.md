# Munchies
Fast food is expensive. This program makes it simple to cook at home and know what you need at the store. If you set this script to run weekly thru something like windows task scheduler it will email you with recipes for every day along with a grocery list. You can also add your own recipes by making your own .json recipe files which are really simple. Enjoy!

Here are the steps,
1) Get a google app password so you can send emails with the script

   NOTE: Do not post this information publicly as others could use it to access your email
3) Go to win
